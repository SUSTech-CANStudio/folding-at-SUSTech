# Folding@SUSTech
![GUI_face](archived/img/GUI_face.png)

**Folding@SUSTech** is a project thriving to further automate the set up process for using [Folding@home](https://foldingathome.org/). *CANStudio* from SUSTech tries to make sure that the users have rather easy access to the *FAHClient* with better connection in mainland China, through the Folding@SUSTech GUI.



## Team SUSTech in Folding@home

-   Team-id: $236305$ (SUSTech).
-   Using student id as identity brings bonus points



## Environment & Dependencies

-   Python 3.7.5
-   [`cx_Freeze`](https://anthony-tuininga.github.io/cx_Freeze/index.html)
-   [TunSafe](https://tunsafe.com/)
-   [Folding@home](https://foldingathome.org/)



## Features of the Wrapper GUI

-   Simple identification process for team SUSTech’s registration (with selectable “Anonymous” option), automatically register the user to team SUSTech
-   Easy Pause/Unpause control
-   Keeps track of FAHClient’s log
-   provides stable connection using [SUSTech server configurations](https://github.com/SUSTech-CANStudio/folding-at-SUSTech-server)
